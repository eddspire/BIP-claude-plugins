# The Ship Loud Commit Bible

## Your commits are your story. Make them legendary.

This guide teaches you how to write commits that Ship Loud's AI can transform into compelling content that builds your audience, showcases your journey, and helps other builders learn from your work.

---

## Quick Reference

### The 4 Pillars of a Great Commit

1. **Clear Intent** (What + Why) — Tell what you did and why it matters
2. **Context** (The Story) — Give enough context to understand your journey
3. **Substance** (Meaningful Work) — Show you did real work worth talking about
4. **Human Touch** (Your Voice) — Let your personality shine through

### Scoring System (0-100, ≥60 = Auto-analyzed)

**Score Boosters:**
- Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc.) → +25 points
- Substantial work (50-500+ lines) → +10 to +35 points
- Multi-file changes (3-10+ files) → +10 to +20 points
- Quality messages with details → +5 to +15 points
- Breaking changes → +25 points

**Score Killers:**
- Generic messages ("update", "fix", "wip") → -30 points
- Tiny changes (<10 lines) → -25 points
- Rapid-fire commits (<5 min apart) → -20 points
- Checkpoint sessions (3+ in 30 min) → -20 points

### Commit Types

| Type | When to Use | Score Boost |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `feat` | New feature or capability | +25 |
| `fix` | Bug fix | +25 |
| `perf` | Performance improvement | +25 |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring | +15 |
| `docs` | Documentation only | +5 |
| `test` | Adding/updating tests | +10 |
| `chore` | Maintenance, dependencies | +5 |

### 9 Content Angles

1. **StoryArc** — Problem → journey → solution narrative
2. **Personality** — Authentic voice, struggles, excitement
3. **Insights** — Lessons other builders can learn
4. **Feature Shout** — What users can now do
5. **Heavy Bites** — Strong technical opinions/decisions
6. **Controversial** — Unconventional approaches taken
7. **Worldbuilding** — How this fits the bigger vision
8. **Unique Perspectives** — Fresh problem-solving angles
9. **Surprise** — Counterintuitive discoveries

### Template

```
feat(scope): [clear description]

[Why this matters - user problem or technical issue]
[Your solution - technical approach]
[Impact - what changed and why it's better]

Stack: [libraries/tools you used]
```

### The Golden Rules

1. **Generic = Invisible** — Be specific
2. **Context is King** — Explain your thinking
3. **Your Commits Are Your Resume** — Make them count
4. **Size Matters** — Batch related changes
5. **Tell the Human Story** — Struggles and breakthroughs
6. **Write for Your Future Self** — Will you understand in 6 months?
7. **Conventional Commits Work** — Use the prefixes
8. **Connect the Dots** — Reference previous work
9. **Quantify Your Impact** — Before/after metrics
10. **Ship It** — Good commit > no commit
